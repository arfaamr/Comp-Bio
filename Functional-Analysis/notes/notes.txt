Mostly general conceptual notes relating to the biological concepts in the workshop, and methods of statistical analysis


-------------------------------
DATASET

Dataset is output of differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq dataset
Differential analysis: comparing individual gene expression between 2 conditions

Context:    Study was performed to investigate genes involved in Fragile X syndrome
            FMRP is a protein whose mutation can cause FX syndrome
            MOV10 is RNA helicase associated with FMRP
                Both regulate RNA translation
                    We expect enrichment of processes/pathways related to mRNA translation/splicing/regulation

goal:  identify differentially expressed genes between control [normal(?)] and cells overexpressing Mov10 *?

GENE ANNOTATIONS

Gene annotation -   "-given raw DNA sequence produced by genome-sequencing projects,
                    add layers of analysis/interpretation to extract biologically 
                    significant info to give context to such derived details-"
                    
                -   essentially, a DNA seq is useless-- no intrinsic info. need to 
                    annotate--so associate more info with the seq: gene, 
                    its products, purpose, etc--to actually learn anything

    *in this workshop we were given genes, not raw DNA seq? So we are further annotating the genes by ascribing 
        purpose, location, categorizing function, etc ?

How to annotate? 
    Access corresponding info in databases -
        general databases:              compehensive info on features [Ensemble, NCBI, etc]
        annotation-specific databases:  annotations about specific topic [Gene Ontology, KEGG, etc]
        etc.

Genomic Build:
    - "version" of the human(or any?) genome reference
    - Recall: Human Genome Project from lesson
        sequencing the human genome - find seq of bases for all dna in human
        99.9% the same per person, 0.01% codes for unique genes
        recall: order of bases is important - mutations result in different order results in diseases etc, which can now be tested for genetically
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hryHoTIHak
    - this reference genome has been continually improved [https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890951-Human-genome-reference-builds-GRCh38-or-hg38-b37-hg19#:~:text=Successive%20%22versions%22%20of%20the%20human,the%20representativeness%20of%20the%20reference]
    
    - KEYPOINT: must use same genome build that was used to develop gene list for analysis, since they may have different names/locations for its features,etc

Accessing databases:
    many R packages exist to query databases:
        org.Xx.eg.db    - gene feature info for particular organism; only latest genomic build available 
        EnsDb.Xx.vxx    - get transcript/gene info using gene ID; can specify version for correct genomic build
        ...these 2 are used in this workshop but there are many more; see link above for full table

Interface tools:    AnnotationHub provides interface for accessing gene databases   [ensembl]
                    AnnotationDbi provides interface for accessing annotation databases     [orgDb, EnsDb]

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS

functional analysis gives more insight on results of differential analysis
    diff analysis returned list of differentially expressed genes
        differential expression: significant change in expression levels between 2 conditions

we can: determine if there is enrichment of biological processes
        group genes based on trends and draw conclusions
        identify global changes

3 main tools for functional analysis:   over-representation analysis, functional class scoring, and pathway topology


Over-Representation Analysis:
    categorize genes into sets by function/location/etc, and determine if a set is overrepresented wrt a reference

    Hypergeometric test:    determines if set is over-represented
                                -determines probability of having same proportion of each set WRT "background sets (?)" of same categories

                            formula:    P(X=k) = ((K ch k)((N-K) ch (n-k)))/(N ch n)
                                        where   k = number of genes in category
                                                n = total genes in list
                                                N = total genes in entire genome
                                                K = number of genes in category from N

    Gene ontology project:  have consistent names/descriptions to easily categorize
        terms are organized into 3 main ontologies:
            1) Biological process: generally involves chemical/physical change. [transcription, apoptosis]
            2) Molecular function: biochemical activity of the gene product. [ligand, transporter]
            3) Cellular component: location in the cell of the gene product. [nucleus, lysosome]

        each term has a name and an accessation number
        a gene product can be associated with multiple terms
        how many depends on its functions and how deeply it has been researched

    --In this specific example:
        background set is all genes that were tested for diff expression, so all genes in results table
        sig gene list is all genes from results with padj < 0.05    [? *i dont know how diff analysis works so I dont really know what this means]

        "Over-representation (or enrichment) analysis is a statistical method that determines whether 
        genes from pre-defined sets (ex: those beloging to a specific GO term or KEGG pathway) are
        present more than would be expected (over-represented) in a subset of your data. 
        In this case, the subset is your set of under or over expressed genes."

        So take set of under/over expressed genes and compare proportions of categories to see if a category is over represented, indicating an anomaly 

    use enrichGO() function

    results: table with 
                - each term from the gene ontology category [in this case, every biological process that was represented]
                - gene ratio: percentage of significant genes that were identified for this biological process
                - bg ratio: percentage of background genes identified for process
                - p-adj/p-val/1-val: other statistical measurements
                - geneID: lists gene IDs of all significant genes that are represented by that term 



Functional Class Scoring:
    looks for large fold changes to determine if certain processes are enriched
    hypothesis:     large changes in individual genes can have significant effects on pathways,
                    but weaker and coordinated changes in functionally related genes can also have significant effects
                    Thus, all genes are considered rather than setting an arbitrary threshold to identify ‘significant genes’, like in ORA

                    The gene-level stats are aggregated to generate a single pathway-level statistic
                    Statistical significance of each pathway is reported

    Gene set enrichment analysis is a type of FCS
        *Ensembl ID vs Entrez ID?

..ERROR

Error in completeSubclasses(classDef2, class1, obj, where) : 
  trying to get slot "subclasses" from an object of a basic class ("NULL") with no slots
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘tidyverse’:
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'dbplyr', details:
  call: setClass(cl, contains = c(prevClass, "VIRTUAL"), where = where)
  error: error in contained classes ("character") for class “ident”; class definition removed from ‘dbplyr’

Triggered by:
    literally nothing?

Tried:
    devtools::install_github("RobinHankin/Brobdingnag")

    update.packages("dbplyr")

    update.packages()   (all the ones without this option: Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?)
                        including matrix [supposedly manually updating matrix is supposed to help]

    devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyverse")     [uninstalled tidyverse and installed its development version using this command rather than install.package()]
        worked

GEN NOTES/ QNS

arg %>% function is fancy syntax for function(arg)
fold change: measurement for change b/w A, B. fold change of B WRT A = B/A



*** visualization ->    for some reason, looks diff -- possibly due to age of workshop? updates made etc
                        hard to manipulate without knowing params, poor documentation
    
    why did it query the databases to annotate, only to not use the results? 
        Just to show how you would find annotation data on your own, if not given?

    what is number of permutations in GSEA?
    due to perms, results will be slightly diff each time..?
    recommended in current version not to have?

    what does warning 4 even refer to?

    how does GSEA really differ from ORA? hypothesis makes it sound relatively similar: testing overall change in category
        apparently, they are relatively similar.?

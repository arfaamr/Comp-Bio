Mostly general conceptual notes relating to the biological concepts and methods of statistical analysis in the workshop

-------------------------------
DATASET

Dataset is output of differential expression analysis on RNA-Seq dataset, in the form of a list of genes
Differential analysis: comparing individual gene expression between 2 conditions

Context:    Study was performed to investigate genes involved in Fragile X syndrome
            FMRP is a protein whose mutation can cause FX syndrome
            MOV10 is RNA helicase associated with FMRP
                Both regulate RNA translation
                    We expect enrichment of processes/pathways related to mRNA translation/splicing/regulation

goal:  identify differentially expressed genes between control [normal(?)] and cells overexpressing Mov10 ?**
            ***? what does this tell us? what's special about these genes wrt context?

GENE ANNOTATIONS

Gene annotation -   "-given raw DNA sequence produced by genome-sequencing projects,
                    add layers of analysis/interpretation to extract biologically 
                    significant info to give context to such derived details-"
                    
                -   essentially, a DNA seq is useless-- no intrinsic info. need to 
                    annotate--so associate more info with the seq: gene, 
                    its products, purpose, etc--to actually learn anything

    *in this workshop we were already given genes, not raw DNA seq? So we are further annotating the genes by ascribing 
        purpose, location, categorizing function, etc ?

How to annotate? 
    Access corresponding info in databases -
        general databases:              compehensive info on features [Ensemble, NCBI, etc]
        annotation-specific databases:  annotations about specific topic [Gene Ontology, KEGG, etc]
        etc.

Genomic Build:
    - "version" of the genome reference
    - Recall: Human Genome Project from lesson
        sequencing the human genome - find seq of bases for all dna in human
        99.9% the same per person, 0.01% codes for unique genes
        recall: order of bases is important - mutations result in different order results in diseases etc, which can now be tested for genetically
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hryHoTIHak
    - this reference genome has been continually improved, resulting in different versions [https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890951-Human-genome-reference-builds-GRCh38-or-hg38-b37-hg19#:~:text=Successive%20%22versions%22%20of%20the%20human,the%20representativeness%20of%20the%20reference]
    
    - KEYPOINT: must use same genome build that was used to develop gene list for analysis, since they may have different names/locations for its features,etc

Accessing databases:
    many R packages exist to query databases:
        org.Xx.eg.db    - gene feature info for particular organism; only latest genomic build available 
        EnsDb.Xx.vxx    - get transcript/gene info using gene ID; can specify version for correct genomic build
        ...these 2 are used in this workshop but there are many more; see link above for full table

Interface tools:    AnnotationHub provides interface for accessing gene databases           [ensembl]
                    AnnotationDbi provides interface for accessing annotation databases     [orgDb, EnsDb]


-------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS

functional analysis gives more insight on results of differential analysis
    (diff analysis returned list of differentially expressed genes
        differential expression: significant change in expression levels between 2 conditions)

we can: determine if there is enrichment of biological processes
        group genes based on trends and draw conclusions
        identify global changes

3 main tools for functional analysis:   over-representation analysis, functional class scoring, and pathway topology

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egO7Lt92gDY describes and illustrates difference between methods

    "Over-representation (or enrichment) analysis is a statistical method that determines whether 
        genes from pre-defined sets (ex: those beloging to a specific GO term or KEGG pathway) are
        present more than would be expected (over-represented) in a subset of your data. 
        In this case, the subset is your set of under or over expressed genes."

Over-Representation Analysis:
    categorize genes into sets by function/location/etc, and determine if a set is overrepresented wrt a reference
    Hypergeometric test:    determines if set is over-represented
                                -determines probability of having same proportion of each set WRT "background sets (?)" of same categories

                            formula:    P(X=k) = ((K ch k)((N-K) ch (n-k)))/(N ch n)
                                        where   k = number of genes in category
                                                n = total genes in list
                                                N = total genes in entire genome
                                                K = number of genes in category from N

    Gene Ontology - way to categorize genes
        terms are organized into 3 main ontologies:
            1) Biological process: generally involves chemical/physical change. [transcription, apoptosis]
            2) Molecular function: biochemical activity of the gene product. [ligand, transporter]
            3) Cellular component: location in the cell of the gene product. [nucleus, lysosome]

    --In this specific example:
        background set is all genes that were tested for diff expression, so all genes in results table
        sig gene list is all genes from results with padj < 0.05

        So take set of under/over expressed genes and compare proportions of categories to see if a category is over represented, indicating an anomaly 

    results: table with 
                - each term from the gene ontology category [in this case, every biological process that was represented]
                - gene ratio: percentage of significant genes that were identified for this biological process
                - bg ratio: percentage of background genes identified for process
                - p-adj/p-val/1-val: other statistical measurements
                - geneID: lists gene IDs of all significant genes that are represented by that term 
    
    - enrichGO() function
    - ENSEMBL IDs
    - categorizing using GO terms



Functional Class Scoring:
    looks for large fold changes to determine if certain processes are enriched
    hypothesis:     large changes in individual genes can have significant effects on pathways,
                    but weaker and coordinated changes in functionally related genes can also have significant effects
                    Thus, all genes are considered rather than setting an arbitrary threshold to identify ‘significant genes’, like in ORA

                    The gene-level stats are aggregated to generate a single pathway-level statistic
                    Statistical significance of each pathway is reported

    Gene set enrichment analysis is a type of FCS
        
    - gseaKEGG() function
    - ENTREZ IDs
    - group based on KEGG pathways      [doesnt necessarily need to use KEGG pathways. could group by GO or any other as well]
    - ranked list sorted by fold changes

    interpreting GSEA plot:
        green plot is ES (enrichment score) - how over/under expressed gene is wrt ranked list
        black vertical bars along the x-axis are genes from input list that feature in the gene-set -> position represents position in ranked list
            ^ explains 2nd graph, but first? 
    
    how to interpret pathview images?



Pathway Topology Analysis:
    Identifies dysregulated pathways by considering gene interaction as well as fold changes and adj p-values
    Determines pathway association by examining number and type of interactions between gene products
    Example not given in workshop


-------------------------------
--USING OWN ANNOTATIONS - functional_analysis_ANN.R

annotations_ahb is provided by workshop
    contains ~56000 genes with gene name, (ensembl) id, entrez id, biotype
annotations_edb contains results from querying EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75
    contains ~20000 genes with "symbol" (gene name?), (ensemble) id, entrez id, genebiotype
annotations_orgDb contains results from querying org.Hs.eg.db, but was inaccurate due to genomic build

replaced annotations_ahb with annotations_edb and replaced relevant column names with corresponding ones
results are relatively similar - makes sense, and means the annotations we queried the dbs for ourselves were also correct


-------------------------------
--CHANGING SAMPLE SIZE - functional_analysis_SAMPLE.R

use sample_n(df, size) to randomly sample rows from original df.

err at dotplot())
    Error in ans[ypos] <- rep(yes, length.out = len)[ypos] : 
    replacement has length zero
    In addition: Warning message:
    In rep(yes, length.out = len) : 'x' is NULL so the result will be NULL

google says "This error message occurs when you try to equate a numeric member of a data structure to “numeric(0)“."

cluster_summary is now empty.
cluster_summary is ego as dataframe.
ego is fine though.

ego is the one used in dotplot() so cluster_summary shouldnt affect it tho.

err at cnetplot()
    Error in graph.data.frame(x, directed = FALSE) : 
    the data frame should contain at least two columns

--why does the workshop use such large datasets?

https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html
suggests dataset size should be 15-500?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egO7Lt92gDY
suggests that the analysis is using ~6000 genes?

GEN NOTES/QNS

fold change: measurement for change b/w A, B. fold change of B WRT A = B/A


visualization?
    for some reason, looks diff -- possibly due to age of workshop? updates made etc
    hard to manipulate without knowing params, poor documentation
    -- alternatives?
    
why did it query the databases to annotate, only to not use the results? 
    -- Just to show how you would find annotation data on your own, if not given?

difference between ORA and GSEA? 
    -- see FCS hyptohesis

why do ORA and GSEA still use org.Hs.eg.db in enrichGO()/gseaGO() functions?
    "#uses ensembl IDs to search the org.Hs.eg.db database, categorize by GO term, and perform over-rep analysis"
    isnt org database genomic version different from dataset, so it shouldnt be used???

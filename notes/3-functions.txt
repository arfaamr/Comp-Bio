-------------------------------------


FUNCTIONS

In general, behave as expected

    functions perform a process - used to modularize and organize project
    function is called by:
        functionName(arguments)
    arguments can contain "objects" to act on and "options" for additional specifications
    when named, dont need to be in correct order

?round              - opens help manual for round()
args(round)         - gives args..
example("round")    - gives ex..

    sqrt(vector) performs function on each element of vector  
    holds for all functions? **


-------------------------------------


MISSING VALUES

NA is returned when function operates on vector with missing data
    na.rm=TRUE          ignores all missing data
    na.omit             generates a function with missing data removed
    complete.cases()    returns logical vector indicating which rows have no missing values 

what does it mean by "missing values"? **


-------------------------------------


USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS

    functionName <- function(arg1, arg2){
        ..function definition..
        return(stuff)
    }

do not need to define type of arg
like local vbs, objects created within function are local to it


-------------------------------------


PACKAGES & LIBRARIES

package - collection of functions, data, etc
library - directory where package is stored
    ^somewhat synonymous

CRAN, Bioconductor repos have useful packages
(must install BiocManager using install.packages first [once]
then, BiocManager::install("packageName") works)

Must install package only once, but load library in each session
Once library is loaded, functions in it can be used like normal?

    sessionInfo()                       - version info about R, OS, attached/loaded packages
    search()                            - list of attached packages

    install.packages("packageName")                         - install package (from CRAN specifically?)
    install.packages("path", type="source", repos=NULL)     - install package from local source files
    package::function_name()                                - execute a function from particular package

    library(packageName)            - load library

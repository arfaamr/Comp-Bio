-------------------------------------

SYNTAX

R - programming language/environment for statistical computing & graphics
RStudio - IDE for R

should organize working directory depending on type of analysis -
    ex: data (raw), results, figures (plots)

code editor -
    not quite like usual?
    code editor essentially console but saved?
    3+5 in console outputs 8 as expected
    3+5 in editor also produces 8 when run
    no need for print(), etc?

    can highlight only selected code to run

console - 
    > enter command (esc to exit command)
    + enter more data

DATA

evalutate expression diff b-w brain samples from mice

counts.rpkm.txt 
    normalized counts file
    contains whole brain samples of RNA seq from 12 mice
    stored in CSV (comma separated values) file
    2D matrix - gene x sample

mouse_exp_design.txt
    metadata file - info about data
    CSV
    sample x info about sample

R is good with categorical data
stored in specific data structure is easier to work with than just a txt

READING DATA 

usually need to read in data to analyze
how depends on type of file and format of data
see table: https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/lessons/04_introR-data-wrangling.html

functions exist to get sense of structure of data, like str(), class(), summary()


-------------------------------------


SELECTING DATA/DATA STRUCTURES+

may want to partition data to focus on certain rows/cols

vectors:

    age <- c(3,5,6)

    indices begin at 1 (ew)
        age[2] gives 2nd element
        age[-2] gives all but 2nd element
    can also index using a vector
        idx <- c(2,3)
        age[idx] gives 5 6
    can index a continuous sequence
        age[1:3] gives indices 1 to 3 inclusive

    can compare vectors with logical operators
    this returns a logical vector
        age > 4 gives vector FALSE TRUE TRUE
    can be used to "filter" original vector
        age[age>4] gives 5 6

factors:

    factors are special vectors, so above methods apply

    can also filter by factor level
        expression[expression == "high"]

-------------------------------------


SETUP

goal: plot average expression / age of mouse

need additional cols in metadata
want to add col of mean expression for each sample.
Could use a for() loop, but there are easier ways

map() family of functions live in purrr package which exists in tidyverse

map()       creates list
map_dbl()   creats numeric vector
map_chr()   creates character vector
etc..

usage: map(object, function to apply)


-------------------------------------


PLOTTING [world domination >:)]

use ggplot() to visualize data
function initializes graph structure to be added to
add to graph using "layers"

geom object specifies type of plot
must set aes() function 
    ggplot(new_metadata) +
     geom_point(aes(x = age_in_days, y= samplemeans))
    
aes() can also specify color based on another column, etc

to keep consistent theme, can put some layers in a function and add that function like any other layer


-------------------------------------


EXPORTING


1) click export on plots page in RStudio

2) use R functions to have it hard coded into script

..Lesson 8 - Tidyverse page does not exist :| ah well it probably wasn't important
